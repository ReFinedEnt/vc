  //             <p>
  //               Oooh! How lovely. As if her mother the queen could help her
  //               right now. This one was charming. It almost made me want to let
  //               go of her. Ha ha! As if. All that planning to infiltrate the
  //               castle and kidnap her would not go to waste. But while she was
  //               in my possession, I might as well have a little fun with her.
  //             </p>
  //             <p>
  //               "I doubt your highness will spare my life if I let you go," I
  //               said to her. She stopped squirming in an instant. "You're a
  //               girl?" she asked with bathed breath. The corner of my mouth
  //               perked up into a smirk. "Last time I checked yes," I told her.
  //             </p>
  //             <p>
  //               "What do you want from me? Do you want money? Power? Men? I can
  //               give you all of that." She tried to sit but it was too much of
  //               an effort, considering she was bound like that. I stifled a
  //               smile. "I have money," I said. "Lots of it in fact. Power comes
  //               with money, so that is not an issue. As for men. Well let's just
  //               say that I like women more."
  //             </p>
  //             <p>
  //               "Then what do you want?" she asked in a small voice. I walked
  //               steadily to her and kneeled on the floor. Once I did, I brought
  //               her to a sitting position and leaned to her head so I could
  //               whisper. "I want your body."

  //               She froze in an instant and squirmed away from me. "You're a
  //               lunatic! Jerk! You're an ugly son of a-" I removed the cover on
  //               her head and watched her mouth slack open as she blinked in a
  //               confused daze at me. I heard her breath hitch as she took a good
  //               look at my face. We studied each other for a while.
  //             </p>
  //             <p>
  //               Her gray eyes took in my features. She licked her thin lips
  //               nervously and asked, "What color are your eyes. They are the
  //               strangest green."
  //             </p>
  //             <p>
  //               I smirked at her. "They're called forest green princess." Before
  //               she could ask another question, I took her in my arms and hauled
  //               her to the bedroom. It was not without difficulty of course. She
  //               kept wriggling against me and even threatened to bite me. What a
  //               charming princess, I thought in disdain.
  //             </p>
  //             <p>
  //               Once we were inside the bedroom, which would be her holding room
  //               or her cell if you want to call it that, I set her down on the
  //               bed where she squirmed some more. I looked her in the eyes. "If
  //               you want me to untie you, you'll stop twitching like that. You
  //               look like a maggot."
  //             </p>
  //             <p>
  //               "I am not!" she said heatedly. I clicked my tongue at her. "Sure
  //               you're not princess."
  //             </p>
  //             <p>
  //               She stared daggers at me. "Why did you kidnap me? You're a low
  //               life! You're the lowest!" she seethed. I gave her a patronizing
  //               look. "And you're a saint princess?" I asked with a smile.
  //               "Don't ask questions that you'll regret knowing the answer to."
  //             </p>
  //             <p>"Are you going to kill me?" she choked. </p>
  //             <p>
  //               "If I wanted to, I would have done it a long time ago. So to
  //               answer your question, no I'm not going to kill you. But I am
  //               going to hold you here for a long time. Look around you
  //               princess. Stare at the four corners of this room because you'll
  //               get to memorize it while you're here."
  //             </p>
  //             <p>
  //               I pointed to the windows. "Those are barred. Even if you cut
  //               that lovely honey colored hair of yours to make a Rapunzel-like
  //               rope, you'll never escape from here." I tilted my chin to the
  //               door where she followed with her gaze. "That is made with metal
  //               and is locked with a security code that only I know of."

  //             <p>
  //               "Wait!" she called out. "Aren't you going to remove my

  //             <p>
  //               Her question made me smile to myself. "Say please," I said. Her
  //               jaw clenched. "Are you freaking kidding me?" she said loudly.{' '}

  //             <p>
  //               "I don't think her highness would appreciate your smart mouth
  //               princess." I faced her and grinned widely. "I'll only remove
  //               that if you say please." She closed her eyes for an instant and
  //               deliberated whether to say it or not. She thought better of it
  //               and said, "Please remove it."
  //             </p>
  //             <p>
  //               I walked back to her and leaned down so I could untie the ropes.
  //               "See? I know there's some manners left in you," I teased. She
  //               pursed her lips and didn't reply. I knew she was angry at me for
  //               kidnapping her and doing this. But who cares? I had my own

  //             <p>
  //               My hands deftly removed the knots on the rope. Once she was
  //               untied, the princess moved her hands around and sat on the edge
  //               of the bed. She stunned me by elbowing my stomach and running to
  //               the direction of the door. Years of judo training kicked in. I
  //               pounced on her and pinned her to the ground where I straddled
  //               her.
  //             </p>
  //             <p>
  //               "You shouldn't have done that," I told her. "My stomach is going

  //               now." She writhed against my grip. "What are you saying? Let me

  //             </p>
  //             <p>
  //               "I'm warning you princess. If you do that again, I'll rip your
  //               clothes off and let you stay here completely naked." That made
  //               her stop. "When I release you, you're going to walk back to the
  //               bed. Understand?" She nodded. I stood up and helped her to her
  //               feet. She headed to the direction of the bed and sat down as
